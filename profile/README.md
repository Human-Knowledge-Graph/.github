# Knaph - The Human Knowledge Graph
## A project to summarize and preserve the core knowledge of human history for future generations

## 🙋‍♀️ Introduction

In today's rapidly growing world of information, it can be challenging to keep track of the evolution of knowledge, even for those who have dedicated their lives to a specific domain. At Knaph, we believe that most of the information in the world is temporary, and only a small portion constitutes the core knowledge. Our goal is to identify this core knowledge, preserve its history, and track whether it is growing or not.

## 🌈 Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in science, philosophy, medicine, religion, and other domains of knowledge. Please send an email to sage@knaph.com to get involved.
